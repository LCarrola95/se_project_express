# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

## Project Description

The WTWR (What to Wear?) back-end project is designed to create a robust server for the WTWR application. This server will facilitate user interactions with the application by providing an API for managing user data and clothing items. The primary goal is to enable users to receive personalized clothing recommendations based on their preferences and weather conditions.

## Functionality

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login processes.
- **Clothing Item Management**: Create, read, update, and delete clothing items.
- **Likes Feature**: Users can like or dislike clothing items, allowing for personalized recommendations.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and clothing item data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication.
- **Nodemon**: Tool for automatically restarting the server during development.

## Running the Project

To launch the server, use the following commands:

```bash
npm run start  # Launch the server
npm run dev    # Launch the server with hot reload feature
```
